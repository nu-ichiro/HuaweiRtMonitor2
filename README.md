# HuaweiRtMonitor2

## Overview
This App fetchs traffic statistics from a Huawei consumer router and shows them on status menu area.
Clicking on the status menu item will bring you a pop-over window with time-series graph of the traffic information.

Tested with Huawei B312-620 LTE CPE, but supposed to work with other fixed and mobile consumer router models. See  https://github.com/Salamek/huawei-lte-api for more information.

## Initial Setup
Click on the gear icon on the pop-over window to access the settings panel. Put account information for your Huawei router.
